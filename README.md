New to GitHub, so I'm gonna GitGud!


Hey-ho! I'm a human shifted by alternate realit(y/ies).
I used to be a committed (to learn) pixel artist, but now it's all about programming and game development for this hog!
Gonna make my own game with realistic (Earth-like) physics & interactions, while making a couple practice Sonic (fan-)games on the side. Those will eventually have fully functional physics (which are more Mobian) too. ^_^

Just know that I'll be adding useful concepts and ideas here over time which will most viewers will find useful. Not everything will be posted here though!
